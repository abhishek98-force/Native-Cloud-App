### Enabling Compute Engine and IAM Services

To get started with using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, you need to enable certain services and set up permissions. Follow these steps to enable Compute Engine and IAM (Identity and Access Management) services:

1. **Sign in to Google Cloud Console**: Log in to your GCP account at [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

2. **Create or Select a Project**: If you haven't created a project yet, create one by clicking on the "Select a project" dropdown menu at the top of the page and selecting "New Project." Otherwise, select an existing project.

3. **Enable Compute Engine**:
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Dashboard" from the left-hand menu.
   - Click on the "Enable APIs and Services" button.
   - Search for "Compute Engine" in the search bar.
   - Click on the "Compute Engine API" from the search results.
   - Click the "Enable" button to enable the Compute Engine service for your project.

4. **Enable IAM (Identity and Access Management)**:
   - Follow the same steps as above to reach the "Enable APIs and Services" page.
   - Search for "Identity and Access Management (IAM)" in the search bar.
   - Click on the "Identity and Access Management (IAM) API" from the search results.
   - Click the "Enable" button to enable the IAM service for your project.
